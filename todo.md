* In Edit Presentations have count of students in presentation, if more than 2 show `View Presentation` button (jared)
* names not being removed from textarea when switching to new presentation (jared)
* Students title doesn't change when switching (jared)

* show start date and section title on presentation watch (jenny)
* When adding students remove them from textarea (jenny)
* make watch presentation show section name and presentation name (jenny)

* When delete presentation or student the back button breaks because you can't go back to what doesn't exist (phil)
    - when you delete something set session to deleted
    - check if deleted then send them to /students /presentations
    - this fairly complex with logic
    - 
* Focus and and select on first form field when create section, presentation, student (tough! - anyone bonus points!!!)
